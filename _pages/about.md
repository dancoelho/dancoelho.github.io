Currently, I am a PhD student at McGill University, Department of Physics, working in Prof. [Nikolas Provatas group](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~provatas/.index.html).

Through theoretical modelling and computational tools, I study the atomic-scale behaviour of materials, particularly metals, and its connection to macroscopic properties. My research focuses on the interplay between atomic species and different phases for a given material processing, and how it affects on the resulting microstructure. Once a theory is developed, a numerical model usually follows, allowing for the simulation of microstructure evolution during specific material processing.


<!-- I obtained my M.S. from the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Program ([PPG-EM](http://www.ppgem.uerj.br/en/index.html)) of the Rio de Janeiro State University ([UERJ](https://www.uerj.br)), supervised by Profs. [José Pontes](http://www.gesar.uerj.br/en/staff/professor-jose-pontes.html) and [Norberto Mangiavacchi](http://www.gesar.uerj.br/en/staff/professor-norberto-mangiavacchi.html). We worked on developing computational modelling of pattern formation in dissipative structures, such as reaction-diffusion systems and Rayleigh-Bénard convection cells. We numerically investigated how stripe orientation is induced by gradients of the bifurcation parameter in the Swift-Hohenberg dynamics, and compared to analytical predictions based on multiple scale analysis whenever possible. -->


<!-- M research on computational materials science (theory and simulation), with emphasis on Pattern Formation, Defects and Microstructures in Nonequilibrium Systems; involving numerical and nonlinear methods (linear stability analysis, weakly nonlinear analysis, etc). Other interests are Metallurgy, Solid State Physics, Nanotechnology and Computational Engineering. -->

<!-- My group research interests are at the intersection of astrophysics, particle physics and cosmology. Our main goal is to extract as much information as possible about what our Universe is made of by considering how astrophysical systems would be affected with the addition of undiscovered particles and interactions. A major focus of our research is understanding the composition and behavior of dark matter, but we are also interested in other extensions of the Standard Model. While primarily theorists, we do occasionally get into the data when it is available. -->

My **research interests** lie at the intersection of condensed matter physics and materials science and engineering: 

* Rapid solidification phenomena, void formation, crack propagation, and hydrogen embrittlement
* Thermodynamic properties of pure materials and alloy systems
* Simulation of morphology and microstructure evolution in metals
* Phase Field (PF) and Phase Field Crystal (PFC) modelling
* Computational tools and numerical methods (e.g., finite element analysis, parallel computing)

<!-- * Mathematical modeling of pattern formation in complex systems
* Nonequilibrium thermodynamics
* Phase Field (PF) and Phase Field Crystal (PFC) modelling
* Amorphous metals formation
* Rapid solidification and defects dynamics -->

<!-- My main goal is accurately describing matter interactions and establishing the connections between atomic-scale behaviour and macroscopic properties as much as possible. A major focus of my research is understanding how complex crystal structures stabilize to form the well-known microstructures experimentally observed in metals and alloys, particularly. Once a theory is developed, a model usually follows and then a numerical analysis of microstructure evolution during a specific material processing can be carried out. While primarily theorist, I do occasionally get into the data whenever it is available. -->

<!-- This is the front PAGE of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
