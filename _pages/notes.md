Useful stuff for physics, engineering, programming, etc (possibly).

## Numerical methods

(Coming soon)


## MyPhysicsLab

A very simple application for several physics simulations. You'll see them animating in real time, and be able to interact with them by dragging objects or changing parameters like gravity. It was developed by Erik Neumann and more information can be found on [his website](https://www.myphysicslab.com).

Here is a compiled version for offline usage: <a href="{{ base_path }}/files/myPhysicsLab.jar" download="myPhysicsLab.jar" target="_blank">myPhysicsLab.jar</a>.
